"handcuffs"
symbol of law and justice, slavery and captivity

Adolph Agbo, in "Values of Adinkra Symbols" notes that handcuffs were introduced in Africa as a result of the slave trade, and later became popular among chiefs in cuffing offenders of the law. "The symbol reminds offenders of the uncompromising nature of the law. It however discourages all forms of slavery."
