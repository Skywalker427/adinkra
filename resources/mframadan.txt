"wind-resistant house"
Symbol of fortitude and readiness to face life's vicissitudes

"This symbol suggests a reinforced or well-built home -- one built to withstand windy and treacherous conditions. It reflects in Asante history a clause in the unwritten constitutution of the Golden Stool. Oral acocunts say that according to that clause, mud houses in Kumasi must be reinforced with turf. This reinforcing would cause the house to be sturdier and resistant to unfavorable weather conditions."
